# Ansible Contributor Summit, Durham 2023

![Ansible contributor summit logo](/images/posts/archive/contributor_summit_202310-durham.png)

The Ansible Contributor Summit is a full day working session for
community contributors to interact with one another and meet with the
Ansible development teams behind the projects like AWX, Galaxy NG,
Molecule, Ansible Lint and Event-Driven Ansible. We will discuss
important issues affecting the Ansible Community and help shape the
future of collaboration.

We are happy to have the opportunity to do a second Contributor Summit
this year, and this time it will be part of DjangoCon US 2023 in Durham,
NC. Our previous experience co-locating the Contributor Summit with
another related event was in February in Ghent, Belgium as part of
CfgMgmtCamp 2023. It was so successful, we wanted to do it again with
another great match.
<!-- TEASER_END -->
## Hello, Durham!

We will be meeting in the "Bull City", the home of Ansible itself and
the inspiration for our beloved mascot, Ansibull. In case you didn't
know, the Ansible office overlooks the Durham Bulls Athletic Park, and
this mixed with Ansible word play is why you might see mentions of bulls
and Ansibulls in Ansible land.

If you can't attend the event in person in Durham, worry not! Ansible
Contributor Summit is a hybrid event, so you will be able to join
online. Details will follow later on how to do it, but we will have both
streaming for the presentations and communication channels to
participate in the hackathons or sprints. Check how to register for the
online event below.
