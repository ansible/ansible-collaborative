<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://mailchi.mp/redhat/the-bullhorn-90">The Bullhorn #90</a>, people stepped up and started to maintain <code>google.cloud</code> again. Therefor, we <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/105#issuecomment-1412001896">had a vote on cancelling the removal process</a> - which was accepted. So this collection will stay in the community package!</p>

<p>community.docker 1.10.15 (<a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/blob/stable-1/CHANGELOG.rst#v1-10-15">changelog</a>) has been released. This is the final release of the 1.x.y release stream; the <code>stable-1</code> branch is now End of Life. If you are still using it, please upgrade to community.docker 2.x.y or (better) 3.x.y. If you are still using Ansible 2.9 or ansible-base 2.10, you will have to use 2.x.y, as 3.x.y no longer supports these versions.</p>
