<h2>PROJECT UPDATES 🛠️</h2>
<h3>AWX Project <a href="https://github.com/ansible/awx">↗</a></h3>
<p>AWX provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of Ansible.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@relrod:matrix.org">relrod</a> contributed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you like logs? <em>I</em> like logs. They make life so much easier! Did you know that AWX lets you configure where its logs are sent? You can configure an external logging aggregation server within AWX's administration settings. A current goal for AWX is to work toward improving the Kubernetes deployment, making it possible to independently scale the task and web parts of the system (which currently live in the same pod).</p>
<p>One of the coupled pieces currently is the logging infrastructure, which makes use of rsyslog and lives in the web container currently. Surprisingly, though, for historical reasons, it is controlled and restarted from the task container using a shared supervisord control socket, when configuration changes. We need to change that to work toward the web/task separation goal. We have come up with a <a href="https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/13183">proposal</a> and possible plan to decouple rsyslog, which will allow for easier scaling of all parts of the system. We don't expect any end-user-facing changes as part of this proposal, but we would love thoughts/questions/comments/feedback from the community about the proposal!</p>
<p>Stop by in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#awx:ansible.com">#awx:ansible.com</a> Matrix room and let us know how you use AWX's logging or any bottlenecks you've run into! We also have much more work to do toward this larger goal. We'll be posting more updates, but until then please reach out on Matrix if you wish to get involved or follow this work!</p>

<p>Hello everyone! My name is Don Naro and I'm delighted to be joining the Ansible community engineering team!! I actually joined the team on October 1 so this is somewhat overdue. What can I say? Things are busy at Ansible! I'm excited to be here and feel it's an honour and a privilege to support the Ansible community. I've got a background as a content developer working with dev/ops teams and am quite passionate about open-source, collaborative workflows, and the value of community.</p>
<p>On the personal side I live in Galway, Ireland with my wife and our two kids. We're cat lovers and enjoy spending time in our garden, playing board games, and exploring nearby beaches.</p>
