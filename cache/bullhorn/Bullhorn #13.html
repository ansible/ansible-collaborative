</ul>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE 2.10.2 NOW GENERALLY AVAILABLE</strong></p>
<p>The Ansible Community team announced the general availability of Ansible 2.10.2 on November 3rd. This update of the ansible-2.10 package should be a drop-in replacement for Ansible 2.9; the roles and playbooks that you currently use should work out of the box with ansible-2.10.2. For more information on what’s new, how to get it, plus schedule for upcoming releases, read <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-devel/SwqsSASkvos">Toshio Kuratomi’s announcement to the ansible-devel mailing list</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE-BASE 2.10.3 NOW GENERALLY AVAILABLE</strong></p>
<p>The Ansible Base team announced the general release of Ansible 2.10.3 on November 2nd. This ansible-base package consists of only the Ansible execution engine, related tools (e.g. ansible-galaxy, ansible-test), and a very small set of built-in plugins, and is also bundled with the larger Ansible distribution. For more information on how to download, test, and report issues, read <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-devel/n8h-Eoh59ds">Rick Elrod’s announcement to the ansible-devel mailing list</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE 2.9.15 AND 2.8.17 RELEASED</strong></p>
<p>The Ansible Core team announced the availability of Ansible 2.9.15 and Ansible 2.8.17 on November 2nd, both of which are maintenance releases. Follow <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-devel/N3Mr-PIGaq8">this link</a> for Rick Elrod’s email to the ansible-devel mailing list, to obtain details on what’s new, installation instructions, and links to the full changelogs.</p>
<p><strong>NEW/UPDATED COMMUNITY COLLECTIONS</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/theforeman/foreman">Foreman Ansible Collection</a> v1.4.0 was released. Most notable changes include: (1) new modules: <a href="https://theforeman.github.io/foreman-ansible-modules/v1.4.0/plugins/job_invocation_module.html">job_invocation</a> and <a href="https://theforeman.github.io/foreman-ansible-modules/v1.4.0/plugins/smart_proxy_module.html">smart_proxy</a>, (2) apypie is now vendored, makes installation on EL distributions easier, and (3) <a href="https://theforeman.github.io/foreman-ansible-modules/v1.4.0/plugins/redhat_manifest_module.html">redhat_manifest</a> supports Simple Content Access. For more details, take a look at this <a href="https://theforeman.org/2020/10/foreman-ansible-modules-v140-released.html">blog post</a> and the <a href="https://theforeman.github.io/foreman-ansible-modules/v1.4.0/CHANGELOG.html#v1-4-0">full changelog</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/sops">Community Sops Collection</a> 0.1.0 has been released. It helps decrpyting and encrypting data with <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sops">Mozilla sops</a>, which allows the encryption of YAML values (and not keys), and allows the use of multiple keys at once and keys from different sources. If you find ansible-vault too restrictive for your use-case, this might be better suited for you. However, it is a bit harder to use in Ansible, since there are no vault plugins.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible/utils">Ansible Utilities Collection</a> includes a variety of plugins that aid in the management, manipulation and visibility of data for the Ansible playbook developer. It is <em>currently under active development</em> and the 1.0.0 version will be released in the first week of December 2020. Contributions to the <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.utils">collection with PRs and issues</a> are welcomed!</p>
<p>Some content will get moved out of <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general">community.general</a> and <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/network">community.network</a> for versions 2.0.0, which will be included in Ansible 2.11. Some of these moves have already been done and initial versions of the new collections have been released. After some testing and once they reach versions 1.0.0, they will be included in Ansible 2.10.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/postgresql">community.postgresql</a> 0.1.0: contains the postgres_* modules from community.general</li>
<li><a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/routeros">community.routeros</a> 0.1.0: contains the routeros* plugins and modules from community.network</li>

Please note that all deprecations planned for removal in community.general 2.0.0 have already been applied. See the <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst">changelog</a> for details.</li>
