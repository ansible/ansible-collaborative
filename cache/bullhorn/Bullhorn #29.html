<p><strong>ANSIBLE DOCUMENTATION UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/index.html">Ansible devel docsite</a> will now always include the latest release version (the latest version that's not a prerelease according to semantic versioning) of all collections that will appear in the next Ansible release, instead of using exactly the same versions as the latest Ansible release. This means that <code>devel</code> for example includes community.hashi_vault 1.3.0, while the latest Ansible release available at time of writing (ansible-4.1.0) only contains community.hashi_vault 1.1.3. Also if community.hashi_vault 2.0.0 would have been released, it would be used for the <code>devel</code> docs, even if future Ansible 4.x.0 releases will only contain 1.y.z releases.</p>
<p>This allows collection developers and users to read documentation for the latest collection release, instead of just having docs for the latest release that's included in some Ansible version.</p>
<p>You can also see that the collection releases mentioned above - theforeman.foreman 2.1.1, community.routeros 1.2.0, and openstack.cloud 1.5.0 - are already documented on <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/index.html"><code>/devel/</code></a>, while <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index.html"><code>/latest/</code></a> contains older versions of these collections.</p>
<p><strong>LOOKING FOR COLLECTION MAINTAINERS/CONTRIBUTORS</strong></p>
