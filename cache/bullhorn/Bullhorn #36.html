</ul>
<h3>CONTENT FROM THE ANSIBLE COMMUNITY</h3>
<p>If you are interested in speeding up your Ansible execution time, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/mhansen/ansible-trace">ansible-trace</a> by <a href="https://github.com/mhansen">Mark Hansen</a>, a plugin for visualising execution time across playbooks, tasks, and hosts. Join in the discussions on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/ansible-project/c/AZJfDONBZjo">mailing list</a> or on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/q49h2d/ansibletrace_visualise_execution_time_of_ansible/">reddit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tnt4brain">Sergey Pechenko</a> has implemented a callback plugin <a href="https://github.com/tnt4brain/ansible-logging-to-db">"log2db"</a> that acts like a stdout plugin, but also writes almost everything into an external PostgreSQL database, which can be useful for audits, etc. The plugin can be configured via standard <code>ansible.cfg</code> mechanics: it supports its own section with a set of keys. The plugin has "batteries included", i.e. no external PostgreSQL driver like psycopg2 should be installed to any box: Ansible-friendly version of pg8000 is included and starts up upon the loading of the plugin. For more info, check out the <a href="https://github.com/tnt4brain/ansible-logging-to-db">plugin repo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/tnt4brain/ansible-pg8k">modified pg8000 driver</a>, and Sergey will be glad to get feedback from you!</p>
