<h2>GENERAL NEWS UPDATES 🔈️</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andersson007_:matrix.org">andersson007_</a> contributed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are happy to announce that the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html#collection-inclusion-requests-workflow">Collection inclusion policy</a> has been recently relaxed by the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html">Ansible Community Steering Committee</a>!</p>
<p>Before the change, for a collection to get included in the <code>ansible</code> community package, it required reviews and approvals made by two Steering Committee members.</p>
<p>Now, one Steering Committee member and one Community (non-Steering Committee) member review and approval will be enough!</p>
<p>This change:
* Should speed up the <code>ansible</code> community package enhancement by involving the broader Community.
* Opens a great contribution opportunity for non-Steering Committee persons.
* Allows community members (especially collection developers &amp; maintainers) to learn a lot by checking together with the Steering Committee members if other's collections satisfy the Collection requirements.</p>
<p>Regular community reviewers will be offered to join the Steering Committee.</p>
<p>Inclusion requests to review:
* <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/35">ibm.spectrum_virtualize</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/48">purestorage.fusion</a>

* <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/47">inspur.ispim</a></p>
<p>How? Copy the <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_checklist.md">Review checklist</a> into a discussion and go through it. See the <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/24#discussioncomment-1485070">complete</a> example.</p>
<p>They are waiting for your reviews!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
