<p><strong>ANNOUNCING NEW COLLECTION MAINTAINERS</strong></p>
<p>We are happy to announce that, since the <a href="https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202103">Contributor Summit in March 2021</a>, the project has found new maintainers, among others:
* Amin Vakil (@aminvakil) and Alexey Znamensky (@russoz) in <code>community.general</code>, and
* Jorge Rodriguez (@Jorge-Rodriguez) in <code>community.mysql</code>.</p>
<p>With their participation, each of the above collections now has 3 active maintainers.</p>
<p>They have done an excellent job with hundreds of merged pull requests and a great history of reviews in different repositories. Their contributions are influencing the whole project as they have helped and are helping to shape very important general documents which live in the <a href="https://github.com/ansible/community-docs">community-docs</a> repository. These include the quick-start guide, contributing file template, review checklist, maintainer guidelines, and other docs that will help many contributors improve Ansible.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Ansible Community and the Community Team, we'd like to congratulate them on getting <code>commit</code> access, and say THANK YOU!</p>
<p><strong>LOOKING FOR COLLECTION MAINTAINERS/CONTRIBUTORS</strong></p>
<p>The following collections - <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/180">community.mysql</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/issues/102">community.postgresql</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.proxysql/issues/39">community.proxysql</a> - are looking for new maintainers and contributors! If you are interested, please refer to the corresponding pinned issues linked via the collection names.</p>
<p><strong>REVIEWS AND FEEDBACK WANTED!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requesting review on <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.netcommon/pull/279">gRPC connection plugin</a>. This PR will add a new connection plugin for gRPC based communication with network hosts.</li>
<li>Requesting review on <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.network/issues/13">Platform agnostics network resource manager role</a> for <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.network">ansible.network</a> collection.</li>
<li>Ansible has a new open source, data-centric, container-first, developer-friendly interface called <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator">ansible-navigator</a> which will be included in the next Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform release. If you don't mind the bleeding edge, try out the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ansible-navigator/1.0.0a1/">alpha-1 release</a> that was released to PyPI on June 1st. We are looking forward to your feedback, issues, and PRs in the <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator">repo</a>. Please help us make this great!</li>
<li>If you are using role argument specs in collections, or are trying them out, please provide feedback for the following PRs:<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/272">Generate role documentation</a> - this PR creates role documentation from role argument specs for the docsite, similarly to plugin and module documentation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/55">Support roles with argument spec</a> - this PR allows antsibull-changelog to auto-detect new roles (it only considers the <code>main</code> entrypoint) in collections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's a feature request for the Cisco ASA collection to have a <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.asa/issues/115">dynamic_filter</a> ASA module which can enable Botnet filtering via Cisco dynamic/static DB. Feedback is welcome from the community as to how often you've used the Cisco ASA botnet filtering feature, and if you want the process to be automated via Ansible Cisco ASA module.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY DOCUMENTATION UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>The collection maintainer guidelines have been merged to the work-in-progress <a href="https://github.com/ansible/community-docs/">community docs</a>. Along with them are other documents that can be used across the collections, such as the review checklist, releasing guidelines, contributing.rst, and quick-start guide. Thanks to everyone who helped out! Feel free to open PRs and share your ideas, as well as refer to the documents from your READMEs, CONTRIBUTING.mds, and so on. When the community docs have settled in a permanent location, we will find and correct all the references in the repositories under the ansible-collections GitHub organization.</p>
