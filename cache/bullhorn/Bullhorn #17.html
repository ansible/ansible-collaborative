</ul>
</li>
<li>2021-02-16: <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/roadmap/COLLECTIONS_3_0.rst">ETA for Ansible 3.0.0 release</a></li>

<p><strong>ACCEPTING NEW COLLECTIONS FOR ANSIBLE 3.0.0</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst">criteria for accepting new collections for Ansible 3.0.0</a> (scheduled for release in February) have been approved.</p>
<p>If you would like your collection to be included in ansible-3.0.0, please try to make your collection conform to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst">the requirements</a> and then <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/new">submit it as a discussion</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you start the discussion, please include a link to the collection on galaxy, a link to the source code repository, a link to the issue tracker, and the GitHub IDs of collection owners that we should contact if there's a problem with the collection later.</li>
<li>We will review the new collection requests that have been submitted on a first-come, first-served basis. The earlier you submit your collection, the more likely you are to get it into 3.0.0.</li>
<li>The review may turn up things that need to be fixed which would delay acceptance.</li>
<li>2021-01-27 is the date by which new collections <strong>must be reviewed and accepted</strong>, so get your collection in as early as possible, i.e. <strong>NOW</strong>! Submitting it close to the deadline may mean that there is not enough time for us to review and approve it resulting in it not being accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The procedure for getting new collections in is <strong>highly likely</strong> to change for the Ansible 4.0.0 release (including who reviews, whether it remains first-come first-served, and so forth).</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE 2.10.5 NOW GENERALLY AVAILABLE</strong></p>
<p>The Ansible Community team announced the general availability of Ansible 2.10.5 on January 5th. This update contains bug fixes and new, backwards compatible features in the contained collections. For more information on what’s new, how to get it, plus schedule for upcoming releases, read <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/ansible-devel/c/QXx1SXJk05c">Deric Crago’s announcement to the ansible-devel mailing list</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NEW/UPDATED COMMUNITY COLLECTIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/mysql">MySQL collection for Ansible 1.1.2</a> has been released.</li>
<li><a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/containers/podman">Ansible Podman collections</a> has a big <a href="https://github.com/containers/ansible-podman-collections/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst">update</a> to 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 releases.

A new module <a href="https://github.com/containers/ansible-podman-collections/blob/master/plugins/modules/podman_containers.py">podman_containers</a> allows you to run multiple Podman containers at once, which saves time and performs faster if you need to run multiple containers in a row.

<p><strong>ANSIBLE COMMUNITY STATS UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>For the last bit of fun in 2020, <a href="https://twitter.com/Gwmngilfen/status/1341417009968537600">Greg re-did</a> the <a href="https://emeraldreverie.org/2019/12/19/visualising-the-community-contributions-to-ansible-modules/">2019 bubble plot</a> for the new world of Collections. As before, it shows the amount of contribution to the various collections, coloured by the amount of contribution from staff vs community.</p>
