<h3>Community strategy 2023 - have your say!</h3>
<p>In recent weeks, the Red Hat Ansible Community Team has been writing up the state of the community in 2023, the issues that we see, and what we think we should do about it. I'm happy to announce that this is now <strong>live</strong> for your comments, questions, and <strong>votes</strong>.</p>
<p>This takes the form of two blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ansible.github.io/community/posts/state_of_the_community_2023.html">State of the Community 2023</a> on where we are at</li>
<li><a href="https://ansible.github.io/community/posts/ansible_community_strategy_2023.html">Community Strategy 2023</a> on what we think we should do</li>
</ul>
<p>I also presented this strategy at the Ansible Contributor Summit two weeks ago in Ghent, so if you'd like to see that, head over to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-AODeqjvss">YouTube</a> for the recording.</p>
<p>In short, we believe the time has come to have a community DNS zone separate to ansible.com, and also to have a project-wide discussion space in the form of a Discourse forum. Crucially though, we don't get to call all the shots - so if you have opinions, or just want to give it a thumbs-up, you can head to the GitHub discussions <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/201">part 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/202">part 2</a>.</p>
<p>See you in the discussion!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/releases/tag/v6.13.0">Ansible-lint 6.13</a> introduces a new feature that allows users to utilize a <code>.ansible-lint-ignore</code> file. This file contains skip-rules that are loaded from the ignore file which is adjacent to the config file. Additionally, users can take advantage of the <code>--generate-ignore</code> argument to dump any current violations into an ignore file.</p>

<p>The Devtools team has just released a stable update for vscode-ansible extension, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible">version 1.2.44</a>, packed with important bugfixes and 2 exciting features:</p>
</li>
<li>First addition is the information regarding a newer version ansible-lint availabilty in the status-bar itself. This ensures that users always have access to the most up-to-date tools and can stay ahead of the curve.</li>

<p>A few updates on what the Networking team is working on:
* we are developing some content related to <a href="https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.ospf/pull/1">interfaces and ospf</a>
* we are working on extending the capabilities of nxos_bgp_global to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.nxos/issues/606">support the creation of neighbour templates</a>; earlier we could use the module to just apply one that is already created
* we are planning to release a <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.ios/pull/745">filter plugin (ace_popper)</a> which acts on a set of acls facts gathered from a network appliance, and removes ace entries on the basis of some matching criteria</p>

<p>Some time ago we started a <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/154">community discussion</a> on how to <strong>mark plugins in a collection as private</strong>. Since ansible-core rejected to implement support for this in the ansible-doc CLI tool, I'm proposing to still standardize this so we can at least implement it in the community tooling, in particular antsibull-docs and antsibull-changelog. Please see my <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/154#issuecomment-1441951838">call to action for how to continue</a> for details. If you are interested in this, please use the <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/154">discussion issue</a> to voice your opinions on this.</p>

<p>Do you have experience with <strong>Prometheus and Ansible</strong>?</p>
<p>ARA Records Ansible playbooks and it has a bunch of information and metrics about tasks, hosts and results.</p>
<p>What should a prometheus exporter to get Ansible metrics out of ara look like?</p>
<p>What kind of queries or monitoring would you like to do?</p>
<p>Your help and feedback would be appreciated!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than two years ago the Ansible Docs Working Group started discussing the use of <strong>semantic markup for Ansible plugin/module documentation</strong>. This resulted in a <a href="https://hackmd.io/VjN60QSoRSSeRfvGmOH1lQ">specification</a> that has been implemented as proofs of concept both for <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74937">ansible-doc and the validate-modules sanity test</a>, as well as for <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/4">antsibull-docs</a>. From the docs perspective this will improve plugin, module, and now also role documentation a lot, and in particular separate markup from content. (Right now you have to use <code>C(...)</code> and <code>I(...)</code> for values and option names, which stand for 'code-style' and 'italics'.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately this has been on hold for a long time since changes to documentation now require approval of various Ansible-related projects. Since it is still unclear when/if this will ever continue, I am <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/53#issuecomment-1441965593">proposing</a> to start implementing this on the community side, i.e. antsibull-docs, so community collections can try to start playing around with this, which will hopefully put some pressure on other projects to move the semantic markup proposal forward. Please use the <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/53">associated discussion issue</a> in community-topics to voice your opinions on this.</p>
