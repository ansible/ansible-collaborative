  title: What is Ansible?
  intro: No matter your role, or your automation goals, Ansible can help you connect teams and deliver efficiencies.
  body1: Ansible is an open source IT automation engine that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other IT processes. It is free to use, and the project benefits from the experience and intelligence of its thousands of contributors.
  body2: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?sc_cid=7015Y000003szaeQAA">Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform</a> combines more than a dozen upstream projects into a unified, security-hardened enterprise platform for mission-critical automation. It builds on the foundation of the open source project to create an end-to-end automation experience for cross-functional teams.
